Many had doubts that Craig would pull it off, but what we get is a hard-hitting thriller unlike any </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2dec fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other Bond movie. </div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y2ded fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Based on the first of Ian Fleming’s original Bond books, thoroughly updated to the present day, Bond </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2dee fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is newly recruited to the British Secret Service MI6.

I’m sure you are all familiar with the blue flag of </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32c6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the UN and with the names of some of its agencies which operate here in Ethiopia. Today I’m going to tell you </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32c7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a little bit about why it was set up, its structure and the nature of its work.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y32c8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let’s start with why it was established. The United Nations was founded in 1945 after the Second World </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32c9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">War by 51 countries with 4 aims: to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32ca fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">among nations in order to avoid any future global conflagrations, to promote social progress, better living </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32cb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">standards and human rights and to be a centre for harmonising the actions of nations. Today, nearly every </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32cc fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nation in the world belongs to the UN: membership totals 192 countries.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y32cd fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So how is the United Nations structured? Well, the United Nations is not a world government so it doesn’t </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32ce fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have a president or a parliament which makes laws. Nevertheless, due to its unique international character, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32cf fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and the powers vested in its founding Charter, the Organization can take action on a wide range of issues, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and provide a forum or meeting place for its member States – large and small, rich and poor, with differing </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">political views and social systems.  The UN System is made up of 30 affiliated organisations including the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">General Assembly, the Security Council, The Secretariat, the Economic and Social Council and other bodies and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">committees as well as the specialised agencies, funds and programmes such as UNDP, Unicef, WHO etc.    </div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y32b6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The work of the UN is central to global efforts to solve problems that challenge humanity and it </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32b7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">reaches every corner of the globe. Although best known for peacekeeping and humanitarian assistance, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32b8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">there are many other ways the United Nations and its system affect our lives and make the world a better </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32b9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">place. Examples of its areas of activity are: sustainable development, refugee protection, disaster relief,  </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32ba fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disarmament, promoting health, expanding food production and human rights. The aim of this work is to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32bb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">coordinate efforts for a safer world for this and future generations.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y32bc fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">So to sum up, the UN exists as a free association of member states to help make our world a safe and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32bd fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decent place for everyone to live in. Its effectiveness depends on the co-operation of its member states and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32be fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ultimately, that of the individuals within those states.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y32d4 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B5.2</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y32d5 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Project 1</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In Amhara; Oromia; Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region; and Tigray, IFAD working with the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has a programme to improve food security, family nutrition </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and incomes of poor rural households by developing irrigation schemes for small-scale farmers in areas that </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y32d9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are prone to drought and food insecurity.
