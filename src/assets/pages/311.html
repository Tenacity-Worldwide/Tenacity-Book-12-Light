The cost of producing the jeans is 100 birr per pair, and then it costs only 1 birr to transport </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc35 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them to a warehouse in France by truck and ship. However, in shops in France they sell for anything between </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc36 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">600 and 1000 birr. Large numbers are exported from France to other parts of Europe and beyond.

However, globalisation isn’t just about business. It is also manifest in mass air travel, the huge </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y330c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">increase in both tourism and migration as well as the spread of culture, language and political ideas.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y330d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Globalisation may be part of our lives, but have we thought enough about the consequences? Let’s look </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y330e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">first of all at the multinationals. They are so powerful they can pressurise governments, particularly of less </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y330f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">developed countries to do what they want. For example a government may be forced to allow a multinational </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3310 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to open factories where it wants them. The factories may then produce polluting chemicals. Although they </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3311 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">provide jobs for local people, they are often very poorly paid and offer no hope of promotion in the company. </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3312 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Furthermore, the opening of the factory may lead to the closure of a locally-owned factory which can’t </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3313 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">compete. The profits from the company all go back to its headquarters in USA, Europe, Japan or China. Then, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3314 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it not longer suits the company to be in that country, it simply closes down its operation and moves on </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3315 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to another place.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3316 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Another point involves the emerging global culture. Young people in particular all wear the same global </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3317 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fashion of baseball caps, t-shirts and jeans. There is also global music, global films and so on. Along with these </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3318 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come ideas and values often at odds with those of traditional societies, and this can lead to conflict between </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3319 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">generations within families. It also means that local traditions are disappearing, and as world languages, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y331a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">particularly English take a dominant role and are seen as more progressive, local languages are at risk of </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y331b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dying out.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y331c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There is, though, another side to globalisation. Statistics show that in the less developed countries in the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y331d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">last twenty years poverty has decreased, as have illiteracy, infant mortality and child labour. There has been </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y331e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a similar increase in access to clean water and electricity. These positive developments are said to be due to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y331f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the increase in world trade and the movement of money around the world. This has meant that less money is </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3320 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">concentrated in the rich world and more people in less developed countries have benefitted from it.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3321 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This is demonstrated when a multinational opens a factory. It employs people to build it and then work </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3322 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in it. While the top manager may be a foreigner, local managers are also needed because of their local </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3323 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">knowledge. These people earn money that is spent in local markets and shops, thus benefits the whole </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3324 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">community. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3325 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Even the spread of global culture has not been entirely negative. With global communications, people are </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3326 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">more aware of what is going on in other parts of the world and are now more critical of conditions in their </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3327 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own countries.  They know their rights and are less tolerant of injustices and corruption. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3328 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Of course, from the earliest times people have travelled from one part of the globe to another. What is </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3329 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">different nowadays is the amount of contact people have with other countries through air travel, satellite </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y332a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">TV and internet communications. Globalisation, whether we like it or not, is probably here to stay. We must </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y332b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">therefore learn to live with it. In Africa especially it is up to all of us to try to make it a force for good and to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y332c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">limit its negative impacts as much as possible.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y332d fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unit 7</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y332e fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A7.3 </div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y332f fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3330 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">When I left school, I got a job in my uncle’s hotel in Lalibela where I worked as receptionist and then front </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3331 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">office manager for about six years. This was useful experience as I learnt the basic skills of hotel management. </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3332 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then I enrolled in a 3-year course in hotel management at the Catering and Tourism Training Institute.
