After your explanation, asking </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2a19 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the question ‘‘Do you understand?” is not very effective as people often say yes, they do because they don’t </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2deb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to appear stupid. It is also unrealistic to expect someone to repeat what you have said. It is much more </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2dec fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">effective to ask some specific questions about your explanation to see what parts of it have been understood </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2ded fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and what parts haven’t, so that you can explain them again. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y2dee fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We have covered only a few topics but the principles underlying them apply to many different situations. </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y2def fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You can keep them in your mind and you may find they help in a variety of day to day situations.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y3273 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B2.6</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3274 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One of the most obvious barriers newcomers may face is a language barrier, if they don’t speak the same </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3275 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">language as their hosts, or even if they speak a different dialect of the same language. This can lead to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3276 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">misunderstandings and a feeling that the newcomer is somehow not very intelligent because he or she can’t </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3277 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">communicate as easily with the hosts as they can amongst themselves. The newcomer on the other hand can </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3278 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">feel excluded and frustrated at not being able to interact fully with the host community.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3279 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Newcomers also face being judged according to stereotypes that the host community has about people </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y327a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from their background. Stereotypes are beliefs that members of a particular race, nationality or cultural group </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y327b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have certain qualities or abilities. Stereotypes may be partly based on fact but may stem from personal beliefs </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y327c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and fears. If you hold a stereotypical view of a person from a certain background, you are going to judge them </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y327d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">according to that, regardless of what they do or say. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y327e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are certain types of behaviour that stem from a newcomer’s cultural background, which may mean </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y327f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that he or she stands out. Different ways of dressing can seem strange as can different ways of eating. Eye </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3280 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">contact too is an interesting phenomenon. “He didn’t look me in the eye” is a strong criticism in some cultures </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3281 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">where failure to have eye contact with someone you are talking to gives the impression that you are lying or </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3282 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">being disrespectful.  In other cultures “He looked me in the eye” is a strong criticism, implying that the person </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3283 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was impolite and disrespectful to an elder or a member of the opposite sex.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3284 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">These and other factors can mean that newcomers are not being judged fairly and as a result they feel </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3285 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">excluded and unwelcome. In the modern world we can all face this treatment as so many of us are likely to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3286 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">find ourselves among people who are different from us. It is therefore important that we try to understand </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3287 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and accommodate difference and communicate directly to the people underneath the difference.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y3288 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">UNIT 3</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y3289 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A3.1</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y328a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I have come to talk to you today as future students of higher education. It takes hard work and sacrifice to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y328b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">get to university and yet a high percentage of those who make it leave without graduating. This is bad for the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y328c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">individual students, bad for the universities and bad for the country. By sharing with you the reasons why </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y328d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">students drop out I hope you will be able to avoid doing so yourselves when you enter university.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y328e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some students drop out because they develop a medical condition which incapacitates them so they are </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y328f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unable to continue. That is unavoidable. Emotional problems can also be a factor. Students studying away </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3290 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from home may suffer homesickness so badly it develops into depression. Or they may find it difficult to make </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3291 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">friends in another part of the country. Students can help themselves in these situations by joining religious, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3292 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">social or sports societies on campus which will help them to enjoy student life. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3293 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Of course some students drop out because they cannot cope with the work. At university you have to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3294 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">manage your own studies: your relationship with your teachers is more distant and if you are living away </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3295 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from home you don’t have your mother chasing after you to make sure you do your homework.  So students </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3296 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">may do badly simply because they don’t know how to manage their study time, or because the course is too </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3297 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tough. In the latter case, this can be helped by going to see one of your teachers and asking what you need to </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3298 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">do to catch up. It may be that you are not suited to your course, in which case you should change to another </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3299 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one. Being on the wrong course is in fact another reason why students drop out. It is very important that you </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y329a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">choose a subject that you are suited to and interested in, rather than one that you think is a good idea or has </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y329b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">high status.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y329c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">By far the most common reason for dropping out is finance. It is expensive to study and the money may </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y329d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">simply run out. I do urge you to make sure your finances are in place before you start.
