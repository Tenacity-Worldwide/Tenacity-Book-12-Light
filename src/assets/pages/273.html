            <div class="t m0 x16 h1b y2ce9 ffe7 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 519.972px;">Eat right!</div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cea ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 498.987px;">First let’s look at what
                you eat. You have probably studied <a onclick="showDictionary('nutrition'); return false;">nutrition</a>
                at school so you know the </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2ceb ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 478.003px;">different food groups.
                Teenagers are still growing so you need foods that help you grow. You need </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cec ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 457.018px;">proteins, which you can
                find in things like meat, fish, beans, <a
                    onclick="showDictionary('groundnuts'); return false;">groundnuts</a>, and milk. Teenagers </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2ced ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 436.034px;">use lots of energy, so
                carbohydrates, which give you energy are important, that means cereals </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cee ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 415.049px;">like injera, maize, rice
                and roots like cassava and potatoes. Oil also gives you energy. Then, too, </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cef ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 394.065px;">you need food which
                protects you against disease and helps you make blood and bones. In other </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf0 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 373.081px;">words, vitamins and
                minerals which are mainly found in fruits and vegetables but also in other </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf1 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 352.096px;">things like meat, fish
                and beans. It is complicated keeping track of all the things in your diet so </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf2 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 331.112px;">the rule you should
                follow is: eat enough of lots of different kinds of food. Avoid filling yourself up </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf3 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 310.127px;">with sugary, fatty food
                so that you don’t want to eat other more nutritious food. Drink plenty of </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf4 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 289.143px;">clean water too. For
                girls it is especially important to eat well to make sure you have strong bones </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf5 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 268.159px;">to bear children and to
                stop you feeling weak during your monthly periods.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h1b y2cf6 ffe7 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 226.206px;">Get moving!</div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf7 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 205.222px;">What about exercise?
                Many teenagers love playing football, basketball, athletics and other </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf8 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 184.237px;">sports and that is good.
                It strengthens your muscles, your heart and lungs. Also, exercise releases </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cf9 ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 163.253px;">chemicals in the brain
                which give you a natural ‘high’, without the use of drugs or alcohol. If you </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cfa ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 142.269px;">do very little sport and
                very little walking your muscles become weak and you don’t feel good. At </div>
            <div class="t m0 x16 h14 y2cfb ffde fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 121.284px;">the other extreme, of
