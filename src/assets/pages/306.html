Most people though </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2aab fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">don’t even try. They look at it and say why can’t you do something we can recognise!

The whole sound that I </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2aae fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make gets through to people somehow and they respond. People in other countries love me!

Sometimes your mind wanders and then you’re in trouble and </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2ab8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">chaos ensues. Some people ignore me and that makes me angry I can tell you, but I take their number and </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2ab9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">often follow it up. It’s important work, lives depend on it and sometimes I enjoy it, but it can be boring </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2aba fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and with all the pollution, it’s not good for our health.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2abb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">6.   <span class="_ _52"></span>I use words, of course, but more like a painter would.

I hope it communicates what I want it to. I am </div><div class="t m0 x36 h14 y2abd fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">very grateful that people find something gets through to them in my work.

Generally </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3260 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">speaking it is better to express the reason for your anger calmly, rather than the anger itself. If you have made </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3261 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this mistake, however, and said something angry or unkind to someone, don’t rush to say sorry.  Take some </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3262 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">time to think about why you were angry and wait until you are able to do this calmly. Then, you can go and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3263 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apologise for your anger and explain the reason for it. If the other person has upset you in some way, you </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3264 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should let them know what it is. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y3265 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">On the other hand if someone is unkind or angry with you, and they don’t react in this way, it is a mistake </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3266 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to ignore it as you will be left with hurt feelings. You should go and talk to them calmly and ask them to </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3267 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">explain the reason for their anger. This also applies to dealing with children: they should be told if they are </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3268 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">doing something wrong or annoying, but if you get angry with them, you will lose their respect and gain their </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3269 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fear instead. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y326a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Good communication involves being a good listener. We all know how good we feel if someone seems </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y326b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">interested in what we are saying. If they remain silent it may be a sign that they are bored, or not listening. So </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y326c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a good listener asks questions and repeats or paraphrases what you are saying and a lot of the time is quietly </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y326d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">listening to you while looking at you and smiling.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y326e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A mistake many people make is thinking that others will be impressed by how much they know.
