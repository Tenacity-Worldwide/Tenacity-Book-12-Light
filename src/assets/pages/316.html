In geological history they have been known to collide </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y33d8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the Earth. If it happened in the modern era it could have a serious impact: changing landscapes and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y33d9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">climate in such a way that it is possible humanity would not survive. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y33da fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To avoid such a catastrophe, scientists have proposed so-called asteroid mitigation strategies.
