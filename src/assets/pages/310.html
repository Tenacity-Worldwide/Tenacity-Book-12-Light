Harmful practices such as overfishing and blast fishing, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32e2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">which uses explosives to kill a large number of fish, had virtually destroyed the coral reefs, seagrass meadows </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32e3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and mangroves, and had drastically reduced the catch. For local people, who rely mainly on fish and sea food </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32e4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for their sustenance and livelihoods, this was disastrous. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32e5 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now, Mabahin fishers catch as much as 10 kilos of fish after just one hour at sea, compared to an average </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32e6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">catch of only 2 kilos in 2005.
