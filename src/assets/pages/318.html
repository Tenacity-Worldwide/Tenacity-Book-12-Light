Many of us rent DVDs or videos or go to cinemas to watch the latest American, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y6b3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">European, Indian and Arabic films. More and more, however, we are able to see Ethiopian-made films.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y6b4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Film-making has been going on in this country for a long time, but independent film-making didn’t take </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y912 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">off until after 1992, when the Association of Film Makers of Ethiopia was founded. This organisation aims to </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 ycb5 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">improve the quality of domestic films by running training programmes here and abroad. Inevitably there is a </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 ycb6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lack of money and resources both for film training and making. Thus many Ethiopian films have been made </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 ycb7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">by Ethiopians who trained and live abroad. For example, Gondar-born Haile Gerima, who made the acclaimed </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 ycb8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">films <span class="fff5">Sankofa</span> (1993) and <span class="fff5">Teza</span> (2008) has been based in the USA since 1967.

To shoot the film he says he had to dust off </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y244d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the old equipment that belonged to the Cinema Corporation of Ethiopia.
