A land of great beauty; the cradle of humankind; one of the oldest </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3389 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">countries in the world; an independent nation since ancient times with a magnificent archaeological and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y338a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">historical heritage. A land of so many cultures we almost can’t count them. And yet to most people in the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y338b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world nowadays Ethiopia is a land of hunger, poverty and war. I am not going to focus today on why that is, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y338c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but rather on what we can do to move forward to a place in the world that would make our ancestors proud. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y338d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In fact the first point I want to make is that we must move away from our great historical heritage which, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y338e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in truth, has become a burden. We must leave it behind. What do I mean by this? Firstly we have to throw </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y338f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">away the vestiges of the past. Many Ethiopians are proud of the fact that we have our own calendar and our </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3390 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">own clock. But in the era of globalisation this cannot continue. Yes, the church can carry on with them, but in </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3391 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">schools, offices and in business they must go. By the same token, Amharic and other local languages have to </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3392 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be taken out of schools and workplaces and replaced with English. In order to take our place in the modern </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3393 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">world we must not only be able to speak but also use a world language. I know these changes will be painful </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3394 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">at first, but it is only be recognising that we have to adapt to life in the 21st century that we can truly progress.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y3395 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My next point concerns an institution which has been the foundation of society in Ethiopia, in Africa and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3396 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in many other parts of the world: the extended family. It is a wonderful thing in many ways: it gives us roots </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3397 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and supports us throughout our lives, but it is also a burden. I am not saying get rid of families, but we have </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3398 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to say our responsibilities start and end with our immediate family. Any young person with promise has so </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3399 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many expectations placed upon them by distant relatives that it is often intolerable. Once they get a good job, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y339a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">everyone has a stake in their good fortune: uncles, aunts, cousins, brothers and sisters with their own families. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y339b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It is too much: it stifles careers, and is one of the major causes of corruption, which in turn is one of the root </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y339c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">causes of our underdevelopment. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y339d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What I am proposing today is drastic, some would say too extreme. Yet the problems as we face cannot be </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y339e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">solved easily, everyone recognises that. It is time to face up to the reality of what is holding us back.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
