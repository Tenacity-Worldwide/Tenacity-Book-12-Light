    </p>

    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2em">
      <!-- <li>Videos</li> -->
      <li>Audio recordings</li>
      <li>Interactive exercises</li>
      <li>Dictionary links</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>
      You can access the book directly at the <b>Tenacity Worldwide</b>
      <!-- <a href="https://sb10-4198aa.netlify.app">website</a> -->
      website, or your school will

    </p>

  <br />
  <div>
    <h2><b>GETTING STARTED</b></h2>

    <img src="assets/images/menu_icon.png" /><br />

    <p>
      In the upper left corner of <i>English for Ethiopia</i>, Student Textbook
      Grade 12, you will see the blue and white <b>Menu Icon</b>. When you click
      on this icon, the main menu will open with links to the Introduction,
      Authors’ Page, Table of Contents, Textbook units, and Appendixes.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are twelve regular units and four revision units. One revision unit
      comes after every three regular units. There are four Appendix sections at
      the end of the book: Verb forms, Phrasal verbs, Vocabulary list, Listening
      texts, and Writing a formal letter and CV.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the <b>Previous</b> button and the <b>Next</b> button
      <img src="assets/images/prev_next_icon.png" style="display: inline" />
      in the upper right corner of every page. Click on these buttons to go to
      the next page or back to the previous page. If you have a keyboard, you
      can also move forward and back by using the right and left arrows on your
      keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>To return to the main menu, click on the Menu Icon on every page. If you are using a smartphone to look at this book, remember to turn the phone to a <i>landscape/horizontal</i> position. This will give you the best view and make the print most clear.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <div>
    <h2><b>USING THE NEW FEATURES</b></h2>

    <!-- <h3><b>Videos</b></h3>
    <p>
      The Ethiopian Ministry of Education has produced a series of videos to go
      with <i>English for Ethiopia</i>, Student Textbook for grades 9, 10, and
      11. The videos cover the same topics and skills that are in a unit. They
      also add more exercises in the regular units of the textbooks. The videos
      are presented by native English speakers and include a person using sign
      language. You can use the videos with the rest of the units or use them
      separately for extra information and review. Your teacher will tell you
      what to do with the videos. If you are studying by yourself, you can
      decide how to use them. The videos in Student Textbook Grade 11 appear in
      a large black video screen in the units. To play a video, click on the
      <b>Play</b> arrow
      <img src="assets/images/play_icon.png" style="display: inline" /> on the
      lower left part of the video screen. Click on <b>Pause</b>
      <img src="assets/images/pause_icon.png" style="display: inline" /> to stop
      the video. Click on the white line and circle below the Play button to
      move forward and back in the video.
    </p> -->
    <br />

    <h3>
      <b>Audio recordings</b>
      <img src="assets/images/audio_player.png" />
    </h3>

    <p>
      The digital version of English for Ethiopia has audio recordings for many
      kinds of listening activities. Reading passages are also recorded to help
      you understand what you read. You can listen while you read.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every audio activity begins with instructions about what you are to do. To
      listen to an audio recording, click on <b>Play</b>
      <img src="assets/images/play_audio_icon.png" style="display: inline" /> on
      the lower left part of the <b>Audio Player.</b> Click on <b>Pause</b>
      <img src="assets/images/pause_audio_icon.png" style="display: inline" />
      to stop the recording. Click on the line to move back and forth, so you
      can listen to parts of the recording again.
    </p>

    <p>
      For <b>Dictation</b> activities, listen to the audio recording of a
      passage, <b>Pause</b> the recording, and go back or forward as necessary,
      to write down everything you hear. Write on a piece of paper or in your
      exercise book. To check your answer, click on the blue
      <b>Show Text</b> button
      <img src="assets/images/show_text_btn.png" style="display: inline" />
    </p>

    <p>
      For audio recordings of reading passages, listen as you read the text.
      Some long reading passages are on more than one page. Look for the
      <b>Audio Player</b> at the top of the next page or pages.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3><b>Interactive Exercises</b></h3>
    <p>
      There are five types of interactive exercises:
      <b
        >Fill in the Blanks, Multiple Choice, Drag and Drop, True/False, and
        Dictation.</b
      >
      When you type in words to answer Fill in the Blanks and Dictation
      exercises, it is important to use the exact same words you read or heard.
      The interactive exercises appear in two parts of the book:
    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 2rem">
      <li>
        There is a set of five or six exercises that review information you
        learned at the end of each regular unit (1-12). These exercises come
        after the Assessment section and are identified by the words:
        <b>Interactive Exercises.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        There are more interactive exercises in the four Revision Units (after
        Units 3, 6, 9, 12). These units have a combination of interactive and
        non-interactive exercises. You can do the interactive exercises right on
        the screen of your computer, cell phone or other device. When you finish
        an exercise you can check your answer by clicking the blue
        <b>Check</b> button
        <img src="assets/images/check_btn.png" style="display: inline" />. For
        the non-interactive exercises, you can write your answers or your essay
        on a separate piece of paper or in your exercise book.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <p>
      For some exercises, you will see only the first question in a set of five
      or six questions. To go to the next question, click on the blue arrow
      <img src="assets/images/blue_arrow_btn.png" style="display: inline" /> at
      the bottom of each question.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes you will only see directions for an exercise, followed by a blue
      button that says <b>Start Quiz</b>
      <img src="assets/images/start_quiz_btn.png" style="display: inline" />.
      Click on the blue button to start the exercise. To check your answers
      after you do an interactive exercise, click on the blue
      <b>Check</b> button
      <img src="assets/images/blue_arrow_btn.png" style="display: inline" />
      at the end of the exercise.
    </p>

    <p>
      After you do a Dictation, click on the blue <b>Show Text</b> button
      <img src="assets/images/show_text_btn.png" style="display: inline" /> to
      see the complete passage and compare what you wrote.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3><b>Dictionary links</b></h3>
    <p>
      <b>Appendix 3</b> (at the end of the book) has a list of important
      vocabulary words from the twelve regular units. These words are listed
      alphabetically by unit. They are
      <a href="javascript:void(0)"> underlined in blue</a> and linked to a
      digital dictionary. The same words appear in each unit of the textbook,
      <a href="javascript:void(0)"> underlined in blue</a>. When you click on an
      underlined word, a window opens with a definition of the word. For many of
      the words, you can click on an audio recording to hear the pronunciation.
    </p>

    <p>Good luck and have fun!</p>
