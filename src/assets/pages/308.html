This is a difficult balance and it is extremely difficult to do a demanding full-time </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2a19 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">job and a full-time university course at the same time. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y2deb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Let me end on a more positive note: some students drop out because they are offered good jobs before </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2dec fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">graduating. If this is the case then it is understandable. A famous example is Bill Gates, the founder of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2ded fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Microsoft who dropped out of Harvard University to work for IBM. His case was exceptional, and if you do this </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2dee fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">you should be sure that the job you are being offered is secure and will lead to as good a career as you could </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2def fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have with your degree.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2df0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y2df1 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B3.1</div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y329e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Hi! My name’s Mekibib and I’m a doctor. It hasn’t been an easy journey and I have learned a lot of lessons. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y329f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Maybe you can learn from my experience.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32a0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In my first year, I was so nervous about failing that I studied all the time. This was not good. I was </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exhausted and I knew it wasn’t getting anywhere. The reason? I wasn’t studying smart and the key to this </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is organisation, planning and prioritising. A friend of mine who was doing business management showed </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">me how to make a study timetable every week and stick to it. I also realised that the bright students asked </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">questions in class and I did the same to fill in the gaps in my knowledge. When our teachers told us to read </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a5 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">something, I read it on my own after class. These things really helped me to keep on top of every topic we </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">studied.  </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32a7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are lots of other study tips I picked up too: about the importance of planning, researching and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">drafting your assignments, about taking notes of the important points in lectures, of preparing for exams and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32a9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tests well in advance and again, of asking for help when you need it. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32aa fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">You have to be organised about the university regulations too. I was often late for classes or even missed </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32ab fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">classes in my first year because I didn’t know where they were. I made the mistake of waiting to be told what </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32ac fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to do, but in fact it is up to you to find out where you have to be and when you have to be there, when your </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32ad fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deadlines are, when your exams are etc etc.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32ae fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Organising my study time meant I could allow myself some time off. After quite a lonely first year, I made </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32af fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some friends and without my family around me, they were essential. I went to them when I was feeling down </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and they came to me when they needed support. Meeting people is part of university life and in fact it is a </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">great time to network: the people you meet may be useful to you in your future career. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y32b2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Somehow I also found time to be in the university netball team. One year, in fact, I was captain and that </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">took up quite a lot of time. I had to give it up in my 4th year when the work was piling up: I knew what had </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to come first. You have to keep your goal in your mind and not let other things get in the way of that.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y32b5 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">UNIT 4</div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y32b6 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B4.2</div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Newly recruited to the British Secret Service MI6, James Bond goes on his first ever mission as an 007 or </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secret agent.

Things don’t go according to </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32b9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plan, and Bond decides to track down the rest of the terrorist cell. This leads him to the beautiful Bahamas </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32ba fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the Caribbean, where he learns that Le Chiffre, banker to the world’s terrorists is participating in a poker </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32bb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. Le Chiffre must win back his money, in order to stay safe among </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32bc fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the terrorist market.

At first doubtful of what value Vesper </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32be fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can provide, Bond’s interest in her deepens as they brave danger together and even torture at the hands of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32bf fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Le Chiffre. The marathon game proceeds with dirty tricks and violence but Bond outwits Le Chiffre to win the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y32c0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">game and in doing so destroying Le Chiffre’s organisation.
