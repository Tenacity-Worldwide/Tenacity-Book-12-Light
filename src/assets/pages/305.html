All through school I have encouraged </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3233 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her to get a good education then she will get a good job, marry well and have a good life in the future. </div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y3234 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It was different when I was young. My father would not allow my sisters to go to school and they were all </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3235 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">married by the age of 15. My girl is different and she will have a different life. But she has her own mind. She </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3236 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">goes to school in the town and she’s picking up ideas there that I don’t like. She talks of going to university in </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3237 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Addis Ababa. She has no elder brothers there to look after her. I don’t mind her going to college in our town, </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3238 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">but not all the way to Addis. She must stay at home until she gets married.  When she gets a job, we will find </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3239 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her a good husband. </div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y323a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Well, that is my idea, but I have heard that she is seeing a boy, another student at her school. Our </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y323b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">neighbour saw them in a café together. When I asked her about it she said she had done nothing wrong. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y323c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She kept silent when I asked her if he was her boyfriend. What will she do next?  If she has boyfriends it will </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y323d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">distract her from her studies, she may get pregnant, and then we won’t be able to arrange a good marriage </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y323e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for her.  </div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y323f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Then there is my son. He is younger than his sister, but also intelligent. He says he will be a businessman. </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3240 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He has no time for school. He wants to leave after Grade 10. He works at weekends with his uncle, my wife’s </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3241 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brother. He is a trader. My son says he will help his uncle expand the business. If he works hard, he will make </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3242 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a good life for himself. But he wants money now: he wants a motorcycle, he wants smart shoes, he wants so </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3243 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">many things. Things he sees on TV. He is also picking up ideas I don’t like. It worries me because he doesn’t </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3244 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">seem to have any real values. Our traditions don’t mean anything to him. He doesn’t want to live as he was </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3245 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brought up. He says he will live in the city. The countryside is not enough for him. Our family have lived here </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3246 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for generations. He must have his roots here. Without roots you are no-one.</div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y3247 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are so many bad influences today: the music the young people listen to, especially the imported </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3248 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">music is shocking and the films and TV programmes are worse. How can our children stay on the right road </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3249 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">with all these things around them? Our ways seem old-fashioned to them. There is a right road but it is </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y324a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">narrow and easy to take the wrong turning. Will my children understand before it’s too late?</div><div class="t m0 x39 h10 y324b fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A1.5</div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y324c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My husband worries about our two eldest children. He is a pessimist and thinks the worst will happen. But I </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y324d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">trust them to do the right thing. I support my daughter absolutely. When I was 15 my father made me leave </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y324e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">school and I was married two years after that. I want her to do the best she can.</div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y324f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She talks of becoming a lawyer. That would be an incredible thing. No-one in our family has been to the </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3250 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">university in Addis Ababa. She is a bright girl and I know she wants to make a good life for herself. I tell her </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3251 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">‘don’t rely on anyone else for your future.  Even when you’re married, make sure you’ll be able to look after </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3252 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">yourself, because you never know what the future holds.’ I know she has a boyfriend but she tells me she is </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3253 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">not going to do anything that will get in the way of her plans. I trust her. </div><div class="t m0 x50 h14 y3254 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">As for my son, yes, he wants money and he’ll do his best to get it. I’m glad he wants to work with my </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3255 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">brother. He’ll make sure my son keeps his feet on the ground. My boy is not afraid of hard work and I know </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3256 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">he has a good heart. He’ll never forget his family, even if he does go to the city. Sooner or later he’ll want a </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3257 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wife and a family and he’ll want them to have a good life. His life will be different from ours, but I think that </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3258 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his heart he has the same values as his father. His father forgets that he was once a young man with big </div><div class="t m0 x39 h14 y3259 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">plans. The older you get, the wiser you become.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
