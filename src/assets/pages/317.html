Global pandemic</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc35 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An epidemic occurs when a large number of cases of a disease occur at the same time. A pandemic is when </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc36 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">this happens on global scale. With the speed at which people move around the world, it is feared that a global </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc37 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pandemic of a yet unknown killer disease could occur on such a scale that huge numbers of people would </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc38 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">die. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 yc39 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">It has to be remembered, however, that no pathogen, in other words a bacteria or virus, affects everybody </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc3a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">as some people will always have natural immunity. Nonetheless medical researchers have to be aware of </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc3b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">possible threats and develop ways of fighting them, such as vaccines or medication, in advance of their </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 yc3c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">occurrence.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y330d fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">3.  Global warming</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y330e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Climate change is a long-term significant change in normal weather pattern. Over the last 20 years </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y330f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">populations in different parts of the world have experienced storms, hurricanes, flooding and drought with </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3310 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">unprecedented frequency. Some climate scientists have suggested that if global warming continues and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3311 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">intensifies it could make the planet uninhabitable.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y3312 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Some people argue that global warming is man-made. If this is the case, we need to stop the activities </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3313 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that are causing it and be able to prevent it from spiralling out of control. However, the whole basis of our </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3314 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">global economy is growth, which to a large extent involves the depletion of natural resources, the clearing of </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3315 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">forests and massive carbon emissions. To persuade people and governments to find other ways of living is an </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3316 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">immense challenge.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y33a4 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">4. The eruption of a super volcano </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33a5 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A super volcano is a large area capable of producing volcanic eruptions. There are six known super volcanoes </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33df fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">around the world. The last one erupted 74,000 years ago in Indonesia. The super volcano under Yellowstone </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">National Park in the USA is due for an eruption. If that happened, the immediate effect would be the deaths </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of millions of people in North America. In addition the gases released could lead to a huge and sudden </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">increase in global warming, and the dust and debris in the atmosphere could block the Sun and cause a </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">worldwide volcanic winter, such as is believed to have happened at other times in the Earth’s history. These </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">events would inevitably lead to millions of deaths worldwide.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y33e5 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Unfortunately no technology exists to avert a volcanic eruption of any kind, least of all that of a super </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e6 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">volcano. All that can be done is for scientists to gain detailed knowledge of what exactly we can expect and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e7 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when it is likely to happen. Another possibility is to make provision for mass migrations to areas far from the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e8 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eruption, or the construction of huge underground shelters where populations could live while the effects of </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33e9 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the eruption make life impossible above ground.</div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y33ea fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">5. The deployment of nuclear weapons</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33eb fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Since the Second World War arsenals of nuclear weapons have existed and these pose a threat to the existence </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33ec fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of humanity. They belong to the small club of nuclear nations such as USA, Russia and China and are </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33ed fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">targeted at nations that are seen as particular threats. The danger of nuclear weapons lies in their accidental </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33ee fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deployment, their use in a regional conflict, for example in the Middle East, or by a terrorist organisation. </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33ef fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A nuclear attack would lead to millions of deaths and a quantity of atmospheric dust that would produce a </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33f0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">dramatic cooling of temperatures across large parts of the globe.  </div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y33f1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">To rid the world of the threat posed by nuclear weapons, world governments must limit their proliferation </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33f2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and ensure that they do not get into the hands of terrorists. Furthermore, it could be argued that the world </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33f3 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">should be working towards the abolition of all nuclear weapons.</div><div class="t m0 x10 h14 y33f4 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> </div><div class="t m0 xf h10 y33bc fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B10.4</div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33bd fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Graffiti can take the form of images or writing on public property, particularly the outsides of buildings. It </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33be fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is done informally and in many countries is a crime for which you can be punished. Some people think it is </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33bf fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">disrespectful and spoils the appearance of public places. Others, however, love it and say it is creative and </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33c0 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">gives a voice to those who have no other way of expressing themselves to a large audience. Graffiti has existed </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33c1 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">since ancient times, with examples that go back to Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Nowadays, some </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y33c2 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">city councils provide graffiti spaces: blank walls where people can draw or write whatever they want.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.498566,0.000000,0.000000,1.498566,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
