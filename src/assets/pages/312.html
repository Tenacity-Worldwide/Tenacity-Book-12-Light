Marketing, bookings, guest relations, arranging tours and excursions for the guests, food ordering, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 yd20 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accounts, personnel management and anything else that comes up! I live in the hotel, in a small house in </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 yd7e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the gardens with my wife and we have one child. My work is always interesting and everyday there is a new </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 yd7f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">challenge. Living here in this beautiful place, far from the city I’m very lucky, but it’s a hard, twenty-four hour </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y203f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">job. I always have my mobile phone switched on, wherever I am so that staff can call me if there’s a problem. <span class="_ _5"></span> </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y2040 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The main qualities you need are the ability to be calm in a crisis! Also, you mustn’t get angry with guests, even </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 yd81 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">when they are being difficult, and you have to find solutions to problems that seem impossible. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y3338 fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3339 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left school after Grade 10 but found it difficult to get a job. I knew I wanted to do something practical and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the end I got a job at a garage. I was employed to serve petrol and then I started helping the mechanics </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and eventually I was made a full-time mechanic. I was determined to improve my situation and studied in </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my spare time. I joined evening classes at the Drivers and Mechanics Training Center, and after completing </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a basic course for auto mechanics, I went on to do a specialist course in motor engines. This meant I could </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">apply for jobs requiring qualifications. I’m now chief mechanic in a regional branch of a large plant hire </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y333f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">company. I am responsible for all the construction equipment. As well as supervising the servicing and repair </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3340 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the equipment, my job involves keeping records of jobs done, parts that have been used and so on. The </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3341 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">firm is very strict about record keeping. I don’t have a supervisor on site, but the company trusts me to do </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3342 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">my job thoroughly and honestly and I can see that this is the way to get on. Once you start trying to trick </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3343 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the company, and I’ve seen others do it, that’s a fast track to nowhere. I’m thinking about doing a degree </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3344 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in mechanical engineering which would mean I could apply for the job of national plant manager and be </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3345 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in charge of all the equipment country-wide. That would be a very responsible job and the salary would be </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3346 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">much better than the one I have now, which actually isn’t too bad. I’ve worked hard to get where I am and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3347 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I still have a way to go to get where I want, and there are no free rides; I have to put in the time and effort. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3348 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I’m married and I’ve got a son and a daughter, who are both at primary school. My wife also works in the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3349 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">company, but in a different department. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y334a fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">C </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y334b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I work for a company which publishes educational books. What do I do? Well, it’s difficult to say exactly. I </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y334c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">usually tell people that I’m the one who keeps the company going! Most of the work that is done here lands </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y334d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on my desk at some time or other. For example invoicing, either sending out invoices or paying them, they </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y334e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">come to me first. I am also responsible for receiving and passing on book orders to our warehouse and then </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y334f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">checking that they have been sent and also for sending out samples. If any problems come up, the director </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3350 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">relies on me to sort them out. I have to supervise all the administrative staff: the receptionists and the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3351 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">secretaries. If we need to recruit staff I have to deal with job adverts and the application process. There are </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3352 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other things as well, but I hope I’ve given you some idea of the variety of things I do. </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y3353 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The job is never done!  When I leave the office everyday, there is always a pile of things waiting for the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3354 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">next day. Obviously the job requires good organisational skills and you have got to be able to deal with the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3355 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employees kindly but firmly. It is very stressful at times but I have learnt to be calm in a crisis and polite to </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3356 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">our customers even when they are being unreasonable. On the other hand, the salary is fair for the type of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3357 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">work I do and I have very little time to feel bored!      </div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y3358 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I left school with the certificate of secondary education and then did a degree in Business Administration </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3359 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for three years. After graduating, I got a job in a small office where I had to do more or less all the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y335a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">administrative work and that was good preparation for this job, I’ve been doing for three years. I am not </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y335b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">married but I’m engaged and hope to get married soon. I will definitely continue my job when I am married. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y335c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In my free time I like emailing my friends and surfing the Internet.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h10 y335d fff0 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A7.5 </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y335e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We are a market leader in copying, scanning and printing machines. So with top-quality products we </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y335f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">are looking for top-quality staff. We know exactly what we are looking for in a candidate. Actually their </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3360 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">background doesn’t matter. Obviously a degree is a starting point because of what it demonstrates and some </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3361 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ability with numbers is important.</div><div class="t m0 x8 h14 y3362 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We also generally like people with some work experience as that gives them an insight into the work </div><div class="t m0 x1d h14 y3363 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">environment here.
