It is his autobiographical account of </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2d8 ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1091.74px;">growing up in a village in Guinea, in West Africa. His father was a goldsmith and had a workshop. </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2d9 ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1070.76px;">He employed a number of apprentices – young boys who were learning the craft – and they lived </div><div class="t m0 x37 h10 y2da ffc fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1049.77px;">in the family compound. Read the text and answer the questions below.</div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2db ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 925.313px;">In the morning when, after some persuasion, we rose, we found the breakfast ready. My mother </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2dc ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 904.328px;">awoke at <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('dawn'); return false;">dawn</a></span> to prepare it. We all sat around the great steaming dishes: my parents, sisters, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2dd ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 883.344px;">brothers, and the apprentices. There was one dish for the men, and another for my mother and </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2de ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 862.359px;">my sisters.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h10 y2df ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 832.886px;">It would not be exactly right for me to say that my mother <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('presided'); return false;">presided</a></span> over the meal: my </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e0 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 811.901px;">father <a onclick="showDictionary('presided'); return false;">presided</a> over it. Nevertheless, it was the presence of my mother that made itself felt first </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e1 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 790.917px;">of all. Was that because she had prepared the food, because meals are things which are mainly </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e2 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 769.932px;">a woman’s business? Maybe. But there was something more: my mother, by the <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('mere'); return false;">mere</a></span> fact of her </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e3 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 748.948px;">presence, and <a onclick="showDictionary('even though'); return false;">even though</a> she was not seated directly in front of the men’s dish, saw to it that </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e4 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 727.964px;">everything was done according to her own rules; and those rules were <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('strict'); return false;">strict</a></span>.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h10 y2e5 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 698.49px;">Thus it was forbidden to <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('cast my gaze'); return false;">cast my gaze</a></span> upon guests older than myself, and I was also </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e6 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 677.505px;">forbidden to talk: my whole attention had to be fixed on the food before me. In fact, it would </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e7 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 656.521px;">have been most impolite to chatter at that moment. Even my younger brothers knew that this </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2e8 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 635.537px;">was no time to <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('jabber'); return false;">jabber</a></span>: this was the hour to pay honour to the food. Older people observed </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2e9 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 614.552px;">more or less the same silence. This was not the only rule: those <a onclick="showDictionary('concerning'); return false;">concerning</a> cleanliness were </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2ea ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 593.568px;">no less important. Finally, if there was meat on the dish, I was not allowed to take it from the </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2eb ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 572.583px;">centre of the dish, but only from the part directly in front of me, and my father would put more </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2ec ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 551.599px;">within my reach if he saw I needed it. Any other behaviour would have been <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('frowned upon'); return false;">frowned upon</a></span> and </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2ed ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 530.615px;">quickly <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('reprimanded'); return false;">reprimanded</a></span>. In any case, my <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('portion'); return false;">portion</a></span> was always so <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('plentiful'); return false;">plentiful</a></span> that I should never have </div><div class="t m0 x4f h14 y2ee ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 509.63px;">been tempted to take more than I was given.</div><div class="t m0 x17 h14 y2ef ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 480.156px;">When the meal was over, I would say: ‘Thank you, Father.’ The apprentices would say:</div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f0 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 459.172px;"> ‘Thank you, master.’ Then I would <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('bow'); return false;">bow</a></span> to my mother and say: ‘The meal was good, Mother.’ </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f1 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 438.187px;">My brothers, my sisters, the apprentices did <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('likewise'); return false;">likewise</a></span>. My parents replied, ‘Thank you’ to each </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f2 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 417.203px;">one of them. Such was the rule. My father would certainly have been <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('offended'); return false;">offended</a></span> to see it broken, </div><div class="t m0 x4f h10 y2f3 ffd fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 396.219px;">but it was my mother, with her quicker temper, who <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('rebuked'); return false;">rebuked</a></span> any <span class="ffc"><a onclick="showDictionary('transgression'); return false;">transgression</a></span>.
