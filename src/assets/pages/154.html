            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19ce ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 861.048px;">and levelled; next good

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19dc ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 525.331px;">made an excellent floor.
                The thatch over the doorway was neatly cut back by the thatcher; it </div>
            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19dd ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 504.346px;">was the custom to cut

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e2 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 399.424px;">sometimes as high as a

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e3 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 357.472px;">The door was made of

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e6 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 294.518px;">long sticks which he

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19e9 ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 231.565px;">opposite side. When the

            <div class="t m0 x29 h14 y19ea ff6f fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 210.581px;">but for ordinary houses
                bark was used. The reeds were trimmed off at the ends when the door </div>
