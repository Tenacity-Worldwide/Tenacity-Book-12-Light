In 1974 two </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3349 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">members of this group, Donald Johanson and Tom Gray, both Americans, made a discovery in a small gully </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3366 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">near the Awash River. </div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y3367 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">After three weeks’ careful excavation they had 300 fragments from a single skeleton, which represents </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3368 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">40 per cent of the total skeleton. The pelvic bone indicated that the skeleton was female. She was 1.1 metre </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3369 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tall and would have weighed 29 kilograms. In appearance she would have been like a chimpanzee from the </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y336a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">waist up but her pelvis and leg bones were almost identical to those of modern humans. This means that </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y336b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">she undoubtedly walked upright, unlike chimpanzees. The team working on the site, called her Lucy, after </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y336c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">a popular song of the time, and that is the name by which she is referred to around the world, except in </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y336d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ethiopia, where she is known as Dinkinesh.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y336e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Dinkinesh belonged to the species <span class="fff5">Australopithecus afarensis</span> and was not human, she was an </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y336f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ancestor of human beings. She is extremely important as she shows that bipedalism – walking on two legs – </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3370 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">preceded an increase in human brain size, the next key step in human evolution. Dinkinesh’s skeleton has </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3371 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">been dated to just under 3.18 million years old.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y3372 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Nowadays, Dinkinesh is stored in the Paleoanthropology Laboratories of the National Museum of Ethiopia </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3373 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in Addis Ababa. On display in the museum is one of the casts of the original skeleton. </div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y3374 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Twenty-six years on from the discovery of Dinkinesh, Ethiopian Zeresenay Alemseged, of the Max Planck </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3375 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany led a team excavating in the Dikika region, not far </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3376 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from the Awash River where Dinkinesh was found. In a block of sandstone he discovered the almost complete </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3377 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fossilised skeleton of an infant girl, like Dinkinesh, <span class="fff5">Australopithecus afarensis</span>. The remains consisted of a skull, </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3378 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">shoulders, part of the vertebral column, knees, leg bones, right arm and some ribs. She was given the name </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y3379 fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Selam and is also in the National Museum of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa.</div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y337a fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Along with Selam were found the lower jaw and teeth of an adult and the remains of several animals: </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y337b fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an early elephant, an otter and a hippo. Unerrupted teeth still in the jaw were revealed by CT scans, which </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y337c fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">indicate that she may have been about three years old when she died. The skeleton is so well preserved that it </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y337d fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is thought that the body was quickly buried by sediment in a flood. </div><div class="t m0 x11 h14 y337e fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Although Selam is often referred to as Dinkinesh’s daughter, the sediment in which she was found dates </div><div class="t m0 xf h14 y337f fff1 fsb fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the remains as 200,000 years older than Dinkinesh.
